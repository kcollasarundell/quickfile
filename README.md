## Quickfile 
Quickfile is an alternative to python simpleHTTPServer. A quick file server in a single binary.
It serves files out from the directory you are currently in on a default port or one specified.

#TODO
1. Add some tests.
1. Add some logging and alerting if the port is already bound.
1. perhaps add the option to specify which directory to serve.
